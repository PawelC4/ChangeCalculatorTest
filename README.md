The ChangeCalculator Program is a program that calculates the change for a certain Cash amount. Inputting the Cash amount into data.txt will return you the amount of the each type of bill needed to make up that Cash Amount, from largest to smallest.
Ex. A cash amount of 323 would return 3x Hundred Dollar Bills, 1x Twenty Dollar Bill, 1x Two Dollar Bill, and 1x One Dollar Bill.

You can input as many Cash Amounts as needed, the Change Calculator will calculate the Change for each Amount and return the SUM of all the Amounts and the Sum of changes for each Amount.
There is currently one main output which is "ConsolePrinter" which prints the results to the Console. There will be different classes for printing the outputs in several different ways.

The Program is seperated into two main Packages labeled "io" and "calc". The io package contains all of the classes and interfaces that are used for the input and output of the program. The calc package contains all of the classes that do all of the computation.

The code is adaptable. You can customize the Currency used by adjusting the Enum "BankNote". There is also a lot of possability for expansion such as adding new front end solutions as well as back end solutions.
